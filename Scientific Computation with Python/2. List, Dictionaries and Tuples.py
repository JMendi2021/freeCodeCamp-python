There are many useful methods for Lists, which we can help with a lot of things. These methods takes in a List of purely just numbers:

"""
The delimiter tells the program how we want to split the word. It means that anything after a delimiter character is what we want to store in the List.
Say that the delimiter is ';' then the follow string ('1;2     ;3;;;4') will be split to: [1, 2     , 3, 4]7
    If there is no character after a delimiter then it is not included

Tuples behaves like a limited versions of list (immutable version) where you can use the following methods:

Comparison Operators works with tuples. First it compares with the first index of each tuple, if the comparison is true then the overall comparison is true. Otherwise, move to the next index and then output false if no more comparison is made.
